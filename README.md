# Description

This repository contains information, and material for the crypotraphy course. 
This material is particularly created for the Cybersecurity course ata EC.




I try to put all the different references, however, if I miss any bibliography or reference, please, let me know. I will put here in the section reference.

## Folders
This repository contains other folders such as
1) [ciphers_A](https://github.com/jaorduc/cryptoClassic/ciphers_A)
1) [ciphers_B](https://github.com/jaorduc/cryptoClassic/ciphers_B)


Following you find some exercises, activities, and references shared during the sessions.


# Exercise ciphers_A

1. Add documentation for the previous code, each line.
1. Create your own code with python or in another programming language
1. Create your decryption code.
1. Encrypt a message and post on Moodle.
1. Counts the letter, and show the frequency for each letter.


# Exercise ciphers_B
1) Implement the function to encrypt and decrypt  one bit, using Strem Cipher Definition 2.1.1, pag. 31 from the textbook.

2) Modidy your code to encrypt a message with less than 20 alphabetic characters.

3) Counts the letter, and show the frequency for each letter.
